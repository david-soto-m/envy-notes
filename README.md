# envy-notes
C++ note taking, diary making, reminder app, in order to get a good grip on c++ syntax and file operations. I wouldn't try to use it in anything that's not the computer it's programmed in. Do so at your own responsibility.

## Warning

You probably would do better by not using this app.
